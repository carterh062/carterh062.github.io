### My bio
##I began developing software when I was a freshman in high school when I picked up an AP Computer Science book that my brother had been reading. I spent hours banging my head against the wall, struggling to understand Java ActionListeners and object-orientation, and can remember the specific moment when I did, and was able to consistently attach events to buttons in the GUI. Ever since that moment, I have loved every second spent developing software, even the most agonizing; including those spent finding and patching mysterious bugs. I continue to love writing and optimizing beautiful, extendable code for readability and efficiency. I also was introduced and fell in love with scouring Hacker News for all of the new frameworks, languages, and paradigms being discussed. ##

##I started my career by writing Java applications that compiled and cleaned statistical data for UPenn Positive Psychology. I was introduced to Django and began developing backend web applications. I worked for the Philadelphia Water Department developing web applications in ASP.NET and mobile applications with Xamarin. From there I took on contract work and ultimately ended up developing a few frontend responsive websites, as well as some mobile applications and backends in NodeJS/MongoDB. I've also worked extensively on modular Javascript based web applications and PHP servers with a MySQL datastore. Recently, I've been learning to manage a full AWS stack, and doing lots of video encoding and streaming with tools like ffmpeg and protocols like HLS. ##

##I've worked on a number of side projects, particularly in the past year. One was an app for socializing political movements that I wrote in Xamarin. Another was a video streaming service that had channels and acted as online TV that users could upload their own content too. More recently, I've been working on a web app for aggregating news articles in realtime. Most backends I write on the side are in NodeJS and Python where necessary, as those are my languages of choice. I have worked on other various libraries and extensions that are visible in my Github. I got a fair bit of my knowledge of Unix and low level systems from tinkering with Beaglebones and other embedded linux systems in many unsuccessful attempts to build quadcopters with cameras and vision processing. ##

##Iâ€™m really good at being passionate about whatever I'm working on, and communicating with a team. I get excited by structuring my code in a way that is very easily read by others. I also am good at beginning to use and test the newest bleeding-edge technologies. ##

##Next, I'm hoping to continue expanding my knowledge, work with teams that are supportive and as passionate as I am, and work on projects that really matter. I would like to do some variant of backend development, as it gives me more opportunity to be creative with my algorithms, but am open to other options as well. ##
