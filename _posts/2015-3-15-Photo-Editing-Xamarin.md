title: Photo Editing Xamarin
---


I wrote this app a few months ago, but I thought I'd make the public aware of it now. It's a [photo editing app](https://github.com/carterh062/PhotoEditIOSXamarin) in Xamarin.iOS. 

I also wrote a binding for the [JSch library in Java to Xamarin.Android](https://github.com/carterh062/JschBindings) to do a fun SSH project at my house on my local network. I will be posting that code shortly.

Another [Xamarin.Android binding for Push Notifications with Parse](https://github.com/carterh062/PushNotificationsBinding)...Not fully working yet, but it is definitely able to send them up to the Parse cloud, and android devices recieve them, but do not recieve the notification.
